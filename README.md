## Icon Card and Page
This card renders an icon, a message header and a description as configured in Card Management. This card has a Custom Configuration component that is used to manage the card icon, message header, description, and the page URL and sandbox options. See: [IconMessageCardConfiguration.jsx](./src/cards/IconMessageCardConfiguration.jsx).

The card includes an overlay \<div\> that intercepts interactions. Any click on the card will cause the page to be launched.

## Iframe Card and Page
This card's iframe source URL is configured by the Admin in Card Management. This card has a Custom Configuration component that is used to manage the card and page URL's and sandbox options. See: [FramedCardConfiguration.jsx](/src/cards/FramedCardConfiguration.jsx). 

The card includes an overlay \<div\> that intercepts interactions. Any click on the card will cause the page to be launched.

## Framed Page
Both cards launch a Page that is entirely composed of an iframe using the configured URL. There are several sandbox options that are also configured.

## Template Card
Both cards in this extension use the "Template Card" feature. This allows the cards to be added in Card Management as a new card instance multiple times, with each instance configured to use different content. See the _template_ block contained in the card block of extension.js
